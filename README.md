# Java Parallel Stream Patternlets

Java parallel stream patternlets are concise & reusable parallel programming mini-patterns that 
succinctly illustrates common solutions to parallel programming problems implemented using Java parallel stream. 
This work is based on the OpenMP patternlets in C language by Joel Adams:

To explore these patternlets, you can open the
